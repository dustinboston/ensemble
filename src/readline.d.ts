/**
 * Asynchronously reads lines from the standard input.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This function provides an asynchronous generator for reading user input line by line.
 * It maintains a history of inputs and handles interruptions gracefully.
 *
 * Why not use Deno's built-in `prompt` function? The node readline module provides much
 * more functionality, including history management, line editing, and more.
 *
 * @returns An asynchronous generator yielding user input lines.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * for await (const line of readline()) {
 *   console.log(`Received: ${line}`);
 * }
 * ```
